# Derek Araujo's Personal Web App

Welcome to my personal web page! This site is designed to be my business card, resume, and media hub all rolled up into one application.

A video walkthrough of the application running can be found [here](https://youtu.be/lD-KjGSY7kE).

Additionally, a blog post on my Medium page about creating this app can be found [here](https://medium.com/@derekaraujo19/do-i-have-a-programmers-brain-438a630859d5).

The Home page features an 'about me' section and a photo.

The MusicPage component is a feed of my portfolio with embedded Spotify links.  Each individual music credit is a child component called MusicCard.

CommentPage features testimonials. The submittable form for user-generated new comments can be found in its child component, Comments.

The Resume section features my selected work experience and education.

The Footnote component features several redirect links to my social media pages.
